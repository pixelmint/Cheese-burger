Hi B
How are you?
I’m fine, thank you.
what are you up to?
You’re are gross, did you know that?
Why do you like to bother me? I have a boo boo on my pinkie.
I’d love to bother you. How’s your pinkie?
It is okay. It could use some TLC. I might put a bandaid on it.
you ready for branches?
Sure.
Without saying a word you can light up the dark/try as i may i could never explain/what i hear when you don’t say a thing/the smile on your face lets me know that you need me/there’s a truth in your eyes saying’ you’ll never leave me/the touch of your hand says you’ll catch me if ever i fall/you say it best when you say nothing at all

i like my girls BBW, yeah
